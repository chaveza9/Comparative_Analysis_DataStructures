# Comparative Analysis of Data Structure

The goal of our project was originally to compare four spatial data structures and two linear data structures as an introduction to each of these data structures. This would have involved a comparison of the amortized analysis of the most basic methods of each of the data structures (find, insert, delete) with the possibility of implementing methods that are significant to each (such as nearest-neighbor query for kd-trees, quad trees, and octrees on randomly generated datasets.
Due to poor planning and time constraints, we ended up only successfully implementing insert and find for both data structures and comparing runtimes. For quad trees a successful nearest neighbor query was run. This report will present the combined results and methods of the spatial data structures implementations. 

In order to run each data structures, the user needs to access the corresponding data structure folder. Each folder contains a separate README file that explains how to run the code
